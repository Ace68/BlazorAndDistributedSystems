# Blazor and Distributed Systems
Example to show how to manage communications between fronted & backend in a Distributed System.


# Scenario
When we have to deal with distributed systems we need to balance three forces 
> - Communication (sync vs async)
> - Persistence (strong vs eventually)
> - Workflow (orchestrator vs choreography)


# What is a Saga?
When your business workflow depends by more than one microservice, you have to manage it.
A Saga is a Long Running Process that involves all the microservices requested. There are two kind of Sagas
> - Orchestrator  
> - Choreography  
As you know, in Software Architecture, all is a Trade-Off, and which kind of Saga you choose is a trade-off.
For this example I choose 
> - Asynchronous communication
> - Eventually Consistency
> - Orchestrator workflow

# The solution
In this solution you can find:  
> - `BrewApp` example of Blazor Modular Architecture with lazy loading in FrontEnd  
A series of microservices: 
> - `BrewUpSagas` to manage the Saga  
> - `BrewUpSales` delegate to receive the orders from pubs  
> - `BrewUpWarehouses` delegate to prepare the beers  
> - `BrewUpLogistics` delegate to send the beers to the pubs
You need .NET 8 installed to run the examples.

# CQRS
Is a pattern used to split the process of writing from the process of reading the data.
It was introduced by Greg Young, and, as every pattern, is not a "one size fit all" solution, so please, handle with carefully!!!

# EventStore
It's a State-Transition Databases that stores not just your data, but the different transitions your data goes through over time. State transitions are events that record not just whatâ€™s changed, but why it changed in the order those changes occurred. This creates a permanent, unchangeable log of all the transitions the data has gone through.

# Muflone
It's an open-source project to help you implementing Domain-Driven Design with Event-Driven approach.

# `Microservices` are not `Distributed Monolithic`
Each microservice in this solution has its own ReadModel (MongoDb) and its own EventStore.

# Run Solution
> - Prepare Infrastructure: docker-compose up -d (inside docker folder)  
> - BrewUpSagas:
> > - docker build -t brewupsagas .
> > - docker run --rm -p 5000:8080 --name brewupsagas brewupsagas
> - BrewUpSales:
> > - docker build -t brewupsales .
> > - docker run --rm -p 5100:8080 --name brewupsales brewupsales
> - BrewUpWarehouses:
> > - docker build -t brewupwarehouses .
> > - docker run --rm -p 5200:8080 --name brewupwarehouses brewupwarehouses
> - BrewUpLogistics:
> > - docker build -t brewuplogistics .
> > - docker run --rm -p 5300:8080 --name brewuplogistics brewuplogistics

You can also use the docker-compose file for each microservice, instead of docker run
